Big News: Excel has Agent Mode

Think Copilot, but instead of just suggesting, it acts inside your workbook.

It builds, edits, and reasons step by step.

I put together a full guide for CFOs, Finance, and FP&A teams on how to use this new AI capability for finance:

It also includes a step by step on how to "download" it.

This way you can see what has been tested and know if it can help you to automate reporting, forecasting, and even build valuation models!

If you want me to send the Excel file with the results just comment "AI Agent Mode" and I can send!

Here’s what Agent Mode can do live in your workbook:

 ✅ Automate budget roll-forwards across tabs
 ✅ Merge messy data into clean Pivot-ready tables
 ✅ Generate full variance analysis with commentary
 ✅ Build multi-tab models like DCFs & 3-statement forecasts
 ✅ Iterate until the output matches CFO-level standards

And the best part? Everything stays editable.

Some sample prompts you can try right now:

"Build a 5-year DCF model with revenue, OPEX, EBITDA, FCF, and terminal value. Format outputs in CFO-ready style."

 "Consolidate actuals from multiple sheets into one clean variance-to-budget report with conditional formatting."

 "Generate a revenue forecast with 3 growth scenarios (Base, Optimistic, Downside) and plot a chart of outcomes."

 "Draft a month-end financial summary with key drivers, risks, and opportunities based on this dataset."

 "Reshape this dataset into a management-ready P&L with standard financial formatting and subtotals."

Hope this guide helps!
