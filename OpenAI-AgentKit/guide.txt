With OpenAI AgentKit, you can now build your own AI agents that connect data, perform analysis, and generate insights — without code.

Here’s what’s possible:

Also I did the first one as example, if you want the Excel file with the data being used and the prompts for the agent just comment AgentKit! 

✅ Forecasting Automation
Build an agent that pulls live data from your ERP and CRM, runs updated forecasts, and explains variances — automatically.

✅ Variance Analysis
Set up an agent to reconcile actuals vs. plan, highlight key drivers, and draft commentary for your month-end close deck.

✅ Cash Flow Management
Let your agent monitor liquidity in real time and simulate stress scenarios on demand.

✅ Management Reporting
Have it generate CFO-ready summaries, charts, and insights — directly in PowerPoint or Excel.

✅ Scenario Planning
Model new business conditions interactively, and let your AI agent test assumptions and visualize outcomes instantly.

How It Works

Design: Build agent workflows in OpenAI’s Agent Builder — drag and drop models, tools, and logic.

Deploy: Embed into dashboards with ChatKit or code with the Agents SDK.

Optimize: Continuously evaluate performance with Evals and Prompt Optimizer.
